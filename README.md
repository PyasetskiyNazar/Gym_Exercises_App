# Exercises Gym App

Site for learning all kinds of exercises for your body.
I used React, MaterialUI, and two separate APIs!

There is a search on the site, which allows you to find the right exercise.
There are also exercise categories.
When studying a specific exercise, you can read the description and watch the video, and also familiarize yourself with similar exercises
You can follow the link to see: https://exercises-gym.netlify.app 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
